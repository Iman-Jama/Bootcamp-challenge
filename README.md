# Bootcamp-challenge

In this weeks challenge, i was asked to refacter code. The main files were HTML and CSS. Below i will explain what I did for each file.

## HTML

I refactered the code in the HTML file to ensure that was semantic HTML.I did this buy replacing the <em>div</em> elements with <em>section</em>, <em>article</em> and <em>main</em> element tags where appropriate. I also made use the <em>aside</em> element in the section of the website which discussed lead generation, brand awareness and cost management. I also made sure the navigation section of the website had a <nav> element and i labelled this element too. I made use of <em>footer</em> and <em>header</em> elements too. Lastly, i also ensure that all the images had alt attributes and that the links were all working. The changes i made ensured that the website was following semantic HTML and would help users who would use assistive technology.

## CSS
  
In the CSS file, I ensured that all the CSS selectors reflected correctly with the correct names, ensuring they corresponded to the correct section of the HTML file. I also made sure that i deleted duplicate areas of code, as i found that some areas had duplicated style and this was not required.
