# Bootcamp-challenge

In this weeks challenge, i was asked to refacter code. The main files were HTML and CSS. Below i will explain what I did for each file.

##HTML

I refactered the code in the HTML file to ensure that was semantic HTML. I did this buy replacing the <div> elements with <section>, <article> and <main> element tags where appropriate. I also made use the <aside> element in the section of the website which discussed lead generation, brand awareness and cost management. I also made sure the navigation section of the website had a <nav> element and i labelled this element too. I made use of <footer> and <header> elements too. Lastly, i also ensure that all the images had alt attributes and that the links were all working. The changes i made ensured that the website was following semantic HTML and would help users who would use assistive technology.
